To run this program, include files List.h, List.c, ListTest.c, Lex.c, and Makefile in the same directory. Running Lex.c uses the format ./Lex <input file> <output file>.

Included Files:

List.h -- Header file for List ADTi
List.c -- Implementation file for List ADT
ListTest.c -- Tests the List ADT
Lex.c -- Indirectly alphabetizes the lines in a file using a List ADT
Makefile -- Makes executables and cleans directory when desired
