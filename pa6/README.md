To run this program, include files List.h, List.cpp, BigInteger.h, BigInteger.cpp, Arithmetic.cpp, and Makefile in the same directory. Running Arithmetic.cpp uses the format ./Arithmetic input-file output-file

Included Files:

List.h -- Header file for List ADT

List.c -- Implementation file for List ADT

ListTest.c -- Tests the List ADT

BigInteger.h -- Header file for BigInteger ADT

BigInteger.cpp -- Implementation file for BigInteger ADT

BigIntegerTest.cpp -- A test client for BigInteger ADT

Arithmetic.cpp -- Performs arithmetic operations given two Big Integers from an input file into an output file

Makefile -- Makes executables and cleans directory when desired
