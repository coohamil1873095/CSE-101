To run this program, include files List.h, List.c, Matrix.h, Matrix.c, Sparse.c, and Makefile in the same directory. Running Sparse.c uses the format ./Sparse inputfile outputfile

Included Files:

List.h -- Header file for List ADT

List.c -- Implementation file for List ADT

Matrix.h -- Header file for Matrix ADT

Matrix.c -- Implementation file for Matrix ADT

MatrixTest.c -- Tests the Matrix ADT

Sparse.c -- Print result to output file the Matrix operations A, B, (1.5)A, A + B, A + A, B - A, A - A, A^T, AB, and B^2 given matrices A and B from the input file

Makefile -- Makes executables and cleans directory when desired
