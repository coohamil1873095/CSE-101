To run this program, include files List.h, List.c, Graph.h, Graph.c, FindComponents.c, and Makefile in the same directory. Running FindPath.c uses the format ./FindComponents inputfile outputfile

Note: My implementation for PA3 builds off of PA2. 

Included Files:

List.h -- Header file for List ADT

List.c -- Implementation file for List ADT

Graph.h -- Header file for Graph ADT

Graph.c -- Implementation file for Graph ADT

GraphTest.c -- Tests the Graph ADT

FindComponents.c -- Performs a Depth First Search on inputted Graph/Transposed Graph and prints the strong components to the outfile

Makefile -- Makes executables and cleans directory when desired
